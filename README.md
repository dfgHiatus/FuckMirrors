# FuckMirrors

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that... removes mirrors*

*<i>OK, this isn't a mod that removes mirrors outright but one that locally disables world space cameras. UI elements, etc. that rely on cameras to render things such a texture onto a 3D surface will break, you have been warned </i>

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
1. Place [FuckMirrors.dll](https://github.com/dfgHiatus/FuckMirrors/releases/tag/v1.0.0) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
